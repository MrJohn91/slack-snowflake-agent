# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an MCP server that bridges the gap between raw business questions and deep Snowflake insights using AI to make data instantly accessible via natural language through Claude Desktop. The server enables users (analysts, ops, sales teams, executives) to query curated Snowflake Gold-layer tables through Claude Desktop's chat interface without needing SQL knowledge.

The system leverages a modern Snowflake data stack structured into Bronze → Silver → Gold layers, with the agent specifically targeting Gold-layer tables for business insights. It uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for secure data access and provides conversational responses through MCP-compatible clients like Claude Desktop.

Key capabilities include understanding business questions like "Which products are most popular among Premium customers?", mapping them to appropriate Gold tables, executing queries securely, and responding conversationally with actionable insights.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to ask data questions in plain English through Claude Desktop, so I can get insights from pre-aggregated Snowflake Gold tables without learning SQL or using complex BI tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a natural language question in Claude Desktop (e.g., "What were daily sales this week?") THEN the MCP server SHALL parse and understand the intent of the question
2. WHEN the MCP server receives a data query request THEN it SHALL convert the natural language to appropriate Snowflake SQL queries targeting Gold-layer tables only
3. WHEN a query is executed successfully THEN the system SHALL return formatted results to Claude Desktop within 30 seconds
4. WHEN a user asks an ambiguous question THEN Claude Desktop SHALL display clarifying questions to ensure accurate results
5. WHEN a user asks about customer segments, product popularity, or sales trends THEN the system SHALL map to appropriate Gold tables like CUSTOMER_PRODUCT_AFFINITY_MONTHLY and DAILY_SALES_SUMMARY

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the MCP server to provide intelligent tools for data access, so that LLM clients can query Snowflake data through a secure, standardized interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an MCP client connects to the server THEN the server SHALL expose three well-defined tools for data access
2. WHEN multiple query types are supported THEN the MCP tools SHALL intelligently route requests to appropriate Gold-layer tables
3. WHEN a query is executed THEN the MCP server SHALL handle the complete workflow from request to Snowflake response
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the MCP server SHALL provide clear error messages and graceful failure handling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the agent to use MCP for secure, modular Snowflake data access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system connects to Snowflake THEN it SHALL use MCP server tools for all database interactions without exposing direct database credentials to Claude Desktop
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL securely manage Snowflake credentials through MCP encapsulation
3. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN each SHALL have appropriate access controls reflecting their Snowflake permissions
4. WHEN MCP tools are updated THEN the system SHALL continue to function without requiring agent code changes
5. WHEN the system needs metadata THEN it SHALL use MCP tools to fetch table schemas and table definitions securely

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of MCP-compatible clients (like Claude Desktop), I want to interact with the Snowflake data through natural language, so I can get data insights through my preferred AI interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question through an MCP client THEN the system SHALL respond with formatted data results
2. WHEN query results are returned THEN they SHALL be formatted as readable tables and summaries
3. WHEN results are too large THEN the system SHALL provide summaries with key insights
4. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN the MCP server SHALL handle concurrent requests appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want the system to minimize technical overhead, so non-technical users can access data without IT intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user wants to use the agent THEN they SHALL be able to start querying data with minimal setup
2. WHEN users ask questions THEN they SHALL NOT need to know table names, column names, or SQL syntax
3. WHEN the system encounters technical errors THEN it SHALL provide user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
4. WHEN users need help THEN the system SHALL provide contextual guidance and examples

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data governance officer, I want all queries to be logged and auditable, so we maintain compliance and track data usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any query is executed THEN the system SHALL log the user, timestamp, query, and results
2. WHEN sensitive data is accessed THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate data masking or access controls
3. WHEN audit reports are needed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive usage analytics
4. WHEN compliance requirements change THEN the system SHALL support configurable logging and retention policies

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want the first milestone to focus on simple, clear business questions, so we can validate the core functionality before expanding capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks "What were daily sales this week?" THEN the system SHALL map to DAILY_SALES_SUMMARY table and return daily sales data
2. WHEN a user asks "Which customer types prefer which products?" THEN the system SHALL query CUSTOMER_PRODUCT_AFFINITY_MONTHLY and return customer segment preferences
3. WHEN a user asks "How do Premium customers compare to Regular customers?" THEN the system SHALL analyze customer spending patterns using DAILY_SALES_SUMMARY table
4. WHEN the system handles these core question types THEN it SHALL demonstrate the complete workflow from Claude Desktop to Snowflake and back
5. WHEN users ask questions outside the initial scope THEN the system SHALL gracefully indicate the limitation and suggest supported query types

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be extensible and maintainable, so we can add new data sources and capabilities over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new MCP servers are added THEN the system SHALL automatically discover and integrate them
2. WHEN the Snowflake Gold table schema changes THEN the system SHALL adapt without requiring manual updates
3. WHEN new query types are needed THEN developers SHALL be able to extend MCP server tools easily
4. WHEN system monitoring is required THEN the system SHALL provide health checks and performance metrics
