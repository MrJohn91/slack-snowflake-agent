# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an AI-powered Slack agent that enables natural language querying of Snowflake data using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and LangGraph. The agent acts as a smart data assistant available directly in Slack, helping business users, analysts, and developers get answers from Snowflake without writing SQL. The system uses secure, modular, open tools to minimize technical overhead for end users while providing seamless access to enterprise data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to ask data questions in plain English through Slack, so that I can get insights from Snowflake without learning SQL or using complex BI tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a natural language question in Slack THEN the system SHALL parse and understand the intent of the question
2. WHEN the system receives a data query request THEN it SHALL convert the natural language to appropriate Snowflake SQL queries
3. WHEN a query is executed successfully THEN the system SHALL return formatted results in Slack within 30 seconds
4. WHEN a user asks an ambiguous question THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions to ensure accurate results

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the agent to use LangGraph for decision-making, so that the system can intelligently choose the right tools and actions for each query.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent receives a user request THEN LangGraph SHALL analyze the request and determine the appropriate workflow
2. WHEN multiple data sources or tools are available THEN LangGraph SHALL select the most appropriate MCP server tools
3. WHEN a query requires multiple steps THEN LangGraph SHALL orchestrate the sequence of operations
4. WHEN an error occurs in the workflow THEN LangGraph SHALL handle graceful fallbacks and error recovery

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the agent to use MCP for secure data access, so that Snowflake connections are managed securely and modularly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system connects to Snowflake THEN it SHALL use MCP server tools for all database interactions
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL securely manage Snowflake credentials through MCP
3. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN each SHALL have appropriate access controls based on their permissions
4. WHEN MCP tools are updated THEN the system SHALL continue to function without requiring agent code changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Slack workspace member, I want to interact with the agent through familiar Slack interfaces, so that I can get data insights without leaving my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user mentions the bot or uses a slash command THEN the system SHALL respond within the same Slack thread
2. WHEN query results are returned THEN they SHALL be formatted as readable tables, charts, or summaries in Slack
3. WHEN results are too large for Slack THEN the system SHALL provide summaries with options to get detailed data
4. WHEN multiple users are in a channel THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want the system to minimize technical overhead, so that non-technical users can access data without IT intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user wants to use the agent THEN they SHALL be able to start querying data with minimal setup
2. WHEN users ask questions THEN they SHALL NOT need to know table names, column names, or SQL syntax
3. WHEN the system encounters technical errors THEN it SHALL provide user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
4. WHEN users need help THEN the system SHALL provide contextual guidance and examples

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data governance officer, I want all queries to be logged and auditable, so that we can maintain compliance and track data usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any query is executed THEN the system SHALL log the user, timestamp, query, and results
2. WHEN sensitive data is accessed THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate data masking or access controls
3. WHEN audit reports are needed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive usage analytics
4. WHEN compliance requirements change THEN the system SHALL support configurable logging and retention policies

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be extensible and maintainable, so that we can add new data sources and capabilities over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new MCP servers are added THEN the system SHALL automatically discover and integrate them
2. WHEN the Snowflake schema changes THEN the system SHALL adapt without requiring manual updates
3. WHEN new query types are needed THEN developers SHALL be able to extend LangGraph workflows easily
4. WHEN system monitoring is required THEN the system SHALL provide health checks and performance metrics
